The following prompts were utilized to update the components, TableRow.jsx and GenericUpdateButton.jsx, with functionality to edit row data in place when the Update button is clicked. 

Date: 11/13/2025
Prompts used to generate JavaScript XML

Prompt 1:
Hey Claude, I am trying to implement a way to make the update button in the table row to allow the user to update the row values in place. The update values will be from server.js, but you do not need to worry about that for now. We do not need to implement any actual CRUD implementation at this time, just make the update button present the values already in place and make them editable.

Prompt 2:
Can you make it to where the first attribute/column is not editable?

Date: 11/06/2025. We used AI tools like co-pilot or ChatGPT for debugging deprecated VITE version errors by copy/pasting error codes from console log to prompt window. The AI tool gave .jsx code suggestions to resolve a pathing bug caused by using an old version of VITE on the engineering server. It did not give a working solution but provided insight into the bug itself.
